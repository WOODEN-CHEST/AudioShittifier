# Audio shittifier
Do you ever hear a nice, high-quality song and think to yourself "the quality of this song is just TOO good"?
Well, worry no more, audio shittifier is here to save the day (if you get it working, that is).

##What does it do?
Audio shittifier simply takes in an audio file and a layout file, and then, using various effects defined in the layout file, turns the audio file into shit quality.
